### Most Basics
JavaScript has five data types: string, number, boolean, array, object. [This page](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp) has neat explanations of all of them)

`console.log()` to print text to the console.

`var x = 10` create a variable `x` with the value `10`, an integer

`var x = "Ten"` create a variable `x` with the value "Ten", a string. You can also use `'` instead of `"`.

`x = 1 + 1` change the value of the variable `x` to `1 + 1`, which is `2`. `x` should already be defined!

```js
var name = "World"
var x = "Hello " + name
console.log(x)
```
Will print out "Hello World"

### Logic

### Arrays and Objects

### Functions

### Shenanigans (bullshit like || and x ? a : b)
