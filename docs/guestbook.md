Hello! Thanks for siting and reading this guide. This page is meant for you to post your comments, questions, and other concerns.

I just wrote this guide to help people and to understand the language better myself. I have no idea if people are even going to read this. Any comment at all is appreciated! And if you have any questions about this guide, I'll try my best to help!
