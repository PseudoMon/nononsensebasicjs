# The No-Nonsense Basic JavaScript Guide for the Novice Web Developer

## So you're learning how to build websites?
You've learned your HTML, you've inducted yourselves to the ways of CSS. You know how to make your websites look nice, but that's all you can do: making a glorified wall magazine. You know the web is capable of so much more than that.

Or maybe you keep hearing this thing called JavaScript whenever you google about how to do the things you want. Maybe you're tired of just copy-pasting those codes without knowing what the heck any of it does.

This guide is here to help you with that.

## Note
* If you haven't learned your basic HTML and CSS, then this guide probably isn't for you yet. Go learn those and then come back!

* This guide isn't a full tutorial on how to use JavaScript. Like, at all. It's just meant to point you in the right direction. I'll try to link you to helpful resources, but you're still on your own! Cheers! 

* If your only knowledge of JavaScript is through jQuery or other libraries, this is a good intro to what goes on *behind* those libraries.

* This guide assumes that you use standard-compliant modern browsers (you most likely are). Nothing cutting-edge, but things will fail spectacularly if you still use, say, Internet Explorer.
